Celine Danhier’s exploration of New York’s no wave cinema features many different famous actors and directors that made their name during this tumultuous and confusing period in the city’s history. The documentary sought to showcase a specific movement that revolved around New York’s artist communities and the waves that they caused during this developmental and transitionary stage in the city’s life. One of the most interesting ideas that Danhier chooses to explore was the unique perspective behind the actions of the artists involved in these creative projects at the time. Traditional understandings of artistic skill and prowess often emphasized the importance of technical ability, and yet the individuals that Danhier sought to capture in this era of New York were adamant about their hatred of technique. John Lurie’s quote that “no one was doing what they knew how to do” only serves to reemphasize this perspective. However, there seemed to be an inherently positive quality to what may seem like a bull-headed refusal to make the best possible art by sticking to what one knew.  Beth B’s story about not knowing how to film and simply learning the ropes of filmmaking by jumping in the deep end reflects a willingness to push boundaries and change the way things were. There is a searching element to this common behaviour amongst the artists of the time, a desire to look past what one can already do, to evolve past what one already is. The seemingly negative means through which these artist communities sought to precipitate this development only served to spur them on to bigger and better things. Danhier’s focus on this aspect of the no wave movement can later be closely tied to one of the most important characters in the film, New York City itself.
The city that is presented in Danhier’s documentary is distinctly different from contemporary New York, a fact that is constantly made visible to the audience whenever the city is shown to them. There is a dark and brooding element that clearly affects both the viewer and the subjects talking about their experiences during this time. However, one is unable to deny the existence of parallels between this movement’s constant attempts to challenge oneself and the city’s own struggles as a poor and downtrodden geographical space, striving to find its own character. Just as painters tried their hand at performing in a band and musicians attempted to create films, the city constantly dared itself to look past what it was already good at and explore other things. The essence of no wave is a mirror into the city’s soul during this formative period in New York’s history, with the sounds and criminal actions of the angry and obdurate artists echoing throughout the city’s streets, theatres, and halls. Furthermore, once audiences managed to look past the seemingly violent and forceful behaviours that characterised these individuals, one would see the creativity and freedom tied to this willingness to shun boundaries that both the artists communities and New York would become known for.

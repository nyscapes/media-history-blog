The poem "Puerto Rican Obituary" by Pedro Pietri is a heart-rending look at the experience of Puerto Ricans in New York City.

Stylistically, Pietri uses a number of devices to convey a message of dispair and isolation that his subjects experience.

_Capitalization_
Throughout "Puerto Rican Obituary," Pietri carefully chooses phrase to capitlaize or leave lowercase, regardless of conventional grammar rules. This split is perhaps best exemplified by a stanza on page 5:
"is a long non-profit ride/
 from Spanish Harlem/
to long island cemetery/"

The author creates a dichotomy between the two areas. Spanish Harlem is a known place for the author and his subjects. Despite the fact that it may not be comfortable or easy living, it is far and away different from the misery and finality of the cemetery.

“learn how to say Coma Esta Usted/
and you will make a fortune”

The phrase, meaning “how are you?” is casual but within the context it is beyond crucial. Pietri presents the phrase within a stanza dealing with yard sales – selling secondhand items to earn a little extra money. What are personal possessions and dignity worth versus some attempt at maintaining a livelihood?

_Refrences_

After reading the poem, my most immediate connection was the Paul Simon song “Adios Hermanos.” I looked into the lyrics further, and according to [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/10/paul-simons-5-most-underrated-songs/246643/) from _The Atlantic_ , the song is part of an album Simon wrote for a short running Boradyway musical. The subject of the song, Salvador Agron, was convicted for killing two teens in 1959.

The subject of the song is obviously tragic, despite of or because of the guilt of Agron. Simon makes use of the slurs hurled at Puerto Ricans, which Pietri likewise makes sure to include.

_Turn of Phrase_

Pietri alters a number of phrases throughout the poem to flip the meaning and draw attention to the plight of his subects.  One particular phrase that stuck out to me was
“social security number to ashes/
 union dues to dust”
The phrase “ashes to ashes and dust to dust” comes from the Bible. _That_ phrase originally is from Genesis 3:19. God tells Adam “For you were made from dust, and to dust you will return.”  This story is literally a death sentence, not only for Adam and Eve but for all of mankind. The first two humans are sentenced to a life of work and misery, as are their children and their chidlren’s children.

Similarly, Pietri’s poem gravely deals with the realities of the life of Puerto Ricans in New York. There is little way to climb out of the whole of poverty and the system built to keep out people like them.

“They worked
ten days a week/

and were only paid for five”

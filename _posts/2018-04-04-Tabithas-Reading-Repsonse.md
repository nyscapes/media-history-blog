# Please Kill Me reading
## By Tabitha Pitre


Please Kill me was an interesting read. I wasn't has familiar with many of the people
that were in this reading, but nonetheless I enjoyed it. What was particularly
interesting was chapter 9. Lee Childers briefly talks about an underground theatre
called, Ridiculous theater and how it became it's own genre of theater.
It followed theatrical traditions, but used drag culture.
Later in that chapter Penny Acarde adds:
>The theater is full of street stars, like homosexuals, heterosexuals and lesbians.

The terms Street stars and underground theater caught my interest. The theater
seemed like a place that connects people who aren't taken serious. These people
being street stars is an interesting way to characterize the type of people
participating in underground theater.

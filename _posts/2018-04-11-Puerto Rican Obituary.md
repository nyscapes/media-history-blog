I tend not to like poetry, I find it difficult to understand and hard to process. But, these poems we read by Pedro Pietro were not only easy to understand, they were emotion provoking. These poems are dealing with the struggles and heartaches that come along with being an immigrant. They deconstruct the traditional notion of the American Dream, and expose it for the sham that it often is. Pietro’s poem “Puerto Rican Obituary” particularly resonated with me. In writing false poetry obituaries of Puerto Rican immigrants, he points out how each of them died wanting more, wanting to be American but somehow always falling short.

  Juan, Miguel, Milagros, Olga, Manuel are the names of the dead Pietro writes about. Each of them hard workers, but each of them never quite being able to attain what they desired; a life that the American Dream promises, “All died waiting dream and hating”. These five people are used to represent the life, and death, of the greater community of Puerto Rican immigrants in the City. The line that really resonated with me was “All died waiting for the garden of eden to open up again under a new management.” Immigrants come to America hoping to be welcomed into the garden of eden, a paradise and a respite from the lives they are coming from, and they come to find the exact opposite. They find a world where other people living in the city take advantage of them, they live in poor conditions where landlords don’t care for them, and they are treated with bigotry. Pietro at the end discusses what he wishes these five Puerto Ricans would have done, and in turn urging the audience to do, which is to look around and see the reality. To see that all of this work and strife leaves you dead and buried with “no underwear”, or without many possessions. The poem ends on a hopeful note though, saying that now the dead are free. That they “do not need a dictionary to communicate with your people”.

  This poem was a visceral way to think about what immigrants in our country have to go through. As someone who’s family has been in America for generations, I can’t even fathom the heartache and pain these immigrants had to face when they came to this country. It was a real reaction in direct opposition to the American Dream I was taught about in AP U.S. History. I knew that immigration is hard and that the way immigrants are treated in this country can be awful, but it isn’t until I read something like this where I am reminded of this fact. It makes sense then why the Nuyorican Poet Cafe was something that was beloved. This cafe was not only popular, it was needed as a way for this community to express what was happening to them. I can see why Miguel Algarín when discussing the Cafe and the poets who performed here places importance on “the ways in which the sharing of poetry allows for an alternative politics: provisional, people-centered, healing.” The community that formed in this Cafe, that allowed these poets to perform, also allowed for a communal healing. A way to purge the anger, pain and hurt that this community was going through, such as what is convey through Pietro’s poems.

Manhattan, claims Luc Sante, like all fortress cities, represents a model of the
theatre. As the waterfront became undesirable, it began to represent the
galleries. The question arises: what represents the stage? It would be
non-other than Broadway and the “anti-Broadway,” most commonly known as the
Bowery (72).

Last week’s class discussion revolved around cultural associations the names
“Broadway” and “Bowery” conjure. Many agreed Broadway is often the epitome of
New York: glamorous, busy, the epicenter of plays and musicals. The Bowery has
not received as much (usually tourist) love as Broadway. In class, people
agreed that the Bowery was known as an alternative scene. This was a
stronghold for the edgy, the rebellious, the punk…the “not as glitzy as
Broadway.” And yet, I could not think of why this association came to be.
Sure, I had heard a few name droppings of the Bowery in songs by Blondie,
Sonic Youth, or Beck but the extent of my knowledge ended there.

Luckily, Sante discusses the Bowery’s history and emergence as the
anti-Broadway, showcasing how these associations came to be and have stuck in
the collective mind of New Yorkers. Broadway was originally home to the circus
while the Bowery was host to the Park Theatre, built on the model of the London
stage (73). While it catered to the elite with (expensive at the time) prices,
cheaper gallery seats filled up with the families of “mechanics,” or working
men.

By the 1830s, the middle class had crept up along Manhattan. Bowery Theatre was
soon “a working-class entertainment,” where the shows on stage often took a
backseat to the commotion in the audience. The theatre became a place of
socialization where men “would chew tobacco and eat peanuts and throw the
shells at each other” and were not shy to show dissatisfaction with the play
either. Asides proliferated and audiences became interactive (calls to mind a
showing _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_). The nature of the Bowery changed.

In the 1940s theatre managers recognized that the elite and educated had left,
thus they freely pursued cheap and vulgar entertainment, focusing on shock and
awe rather than substantial plot. The Bowery was an Irish stronghold,
epitomized by the character of Moses Humphreys, once a member of a fire company.
The reality of Moses is beside the point. It’s his myth, legacy, and most
importantly, his portrayal by Frank Chanfrau in the drama A Glance of New York
that has resounding impact. The Moses dramas and stories focused on the
proletariat rather than the heroic (80). Moses was a representation of the
Bowery audience.

Broadway proliferated the musical with _The Black Crook_, and soon every theatre
was cranking out musicals. As Broadway moved northward it became the
“territory of a newly organized motley public” (89). Broadway festered with
“playboys, reporters, gamblers, bohemians…” (89). The Bowery’s knack at
producing huge budget spectacles now were dwarfed by “what the vast spaces of
Madison Square Garden could offer,” like more elaborate sets, battles, and
replications (90).

These associations have stood the test of time. Just the name the Bowery
usually implies lowbrow or now more so “anti-Broadway.” Perhaps the grime and
dirt the Bowery once represented is now synonymous with a “real New York.”

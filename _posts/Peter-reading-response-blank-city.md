The downtown music scene of New York is certainly a fascinating one with a rich history. However, as history has moved forward there seems to be a certain sense of tone-deafness from the mostly white filmmakers seen in the documentary. This would be my second time watching this documentary, and I hadn't quite noticed this the first time, as I had not lived in NYC proper upon my first viewing.

To wax on about the freedom of living in downtown Manhattan with its then poverty rates, as some sort of wild west situation erases the history of the people who are living there not out of choice. An artist like Jarmusch has a certain level of volition going into downtown.

This is sort of remedied with the section on Charlie Ahearn's "Wild Style" discussing the parallel between Bronx hip hop culture and downtown punk culture. One person says that both came out of "not having money.", though not really elaborating on the difference of why the two scenes have money.

I am not trying to berate the filmmakers, as looking for affordable places to make art is always appealing, I'm just wondering if in today's discourse, we could allow such a scene to exist anywhere in New York, without baggage of gentrification and "hipsters."

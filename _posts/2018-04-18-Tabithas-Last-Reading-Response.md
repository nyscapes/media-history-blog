I realized the influence drug habits were in the 70's and
80's, especially within the Rock and Roll and Punk rock
scene.
Reading these stories especially the one when Richard was
allowed to stay with Terry Ork only if he was able to provide
the drugs oppose to rent money. The way Richard Lloyd
described using as giving you opium dreams and how it seemed
like a safe drug.

Penny Arcades story in chapter 20, So You Wanna Be a Rock &
Roll Star, intrigued me it was as if she was looking at a
life she probably would've lived if she never moved to Maine.
She described the hype over her old friend Patti Smith, who
was trying to avoid Penny. That part was kind of sad because
before Penny decided to leave, Patti had a crowd of teenagers
and fans yelling her name but it was as if they were calling
out a different persona than the persona Penny is wanting to
speak to. But Patti couldn't begin to handle holding a convo
with a old friend. As if she's in the sunken place of fame.
